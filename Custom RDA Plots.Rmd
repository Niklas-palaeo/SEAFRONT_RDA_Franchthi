# Info
This script works along the `RDA_Vegan.Rmd` or the `RDA_Short.Rmd` script and is only for customising the RDA Plot.


```{r}

# Define the dataset you want to analyse

Data <- All_RDA
# plot.new()

## extract % explained by the first 2 axes
perc <- round(100*(summary(Data)$cont$importance[2, 1:2]), 2)

## extract scores - these are coordinates in the RDA space
sc_si <- scores(Data, display="sites", choices=c(1,2), scaling=1)
sc_sp <- scores(Data, display="species", choices=c(1,2), scaling=1)
sc_bp <- scores(Data, display="bp", choices=c(1, 2), scaling=1)

## Custom triplot, step by step
